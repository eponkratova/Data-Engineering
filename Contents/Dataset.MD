# About My Dataset
I used credit card complaints data set for my project. It has 18 columns and 80k rows. Columns are of Date, Text and Number types.  The dataset is a CSV file.
you can find the dataset [Credit Card Complaints]( https://data.world/dataquest/bank-and-credit-card-complaints)
# Why i choose it?
When I started to persue Data Engineering, I did a research on industry that are posting jobs.  Banking and Telecommunication are the top two sectors posting jobs.  It should be relevent to do hands on project relating to these industries and that made mademe to narrow down the data set.
