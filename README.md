# Data Engineering with AWS
Data Pipe Lines with AWS

# Introduction & Goals
- The project is about building data pipeline for Credit Card Complaints data.  It takes the general [blueprint](https://github.com/andkret/Cookbook/blob/master/sections/01-Introduction.md#my-data-science-platform-blueprint) as a baseline for selecting the tool set,  I choose AWS based on industry research.


This Project has mainly classified into three phases,

  - Initial phase : Research on the industries about technical stack that are used in Data Engineering.

    Choosing your data set.

  - Second Phase : Designing and developing the pipeline with tools and data source.
  - Third Phase : Documentation for the project and grouping the code used in various phases of development

  #### With what data are you working 
  I am working with credit card complaints data and nuances of dataset has been explained in my blog
  - What tools are you using
  - What are you doing with these tools
  - Once you are finished add the conclusion here as well
